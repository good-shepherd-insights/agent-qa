# DELETION-INVENTORY

A dated register of things this repository deliberately DELETED, and — just as important — of the
things it deliberately RETAINED beside them so that data written by the deleted machinery keeps
parsing and keeps rendering.

Each section is owned by the plan that wrote it. A later plan extends this file with a new dated
section; it does not rewrite an existing one.

## 2026-08-24 — the suite-parent / child-run model (Phase 402 plan 09, D-11)

**Owner's ruling, verbatim (402-CONTEXT.md D-11):** *"remove everything that's not required. Better
to cleanup now than maintain tumors."*

**What "required" means here, and who decided it.** Not judgment — a census. Two predicates of
deliberately different shape were run over the shipped sources and the running system, and every
site either of them discovered appears in the tables below with exactly one disposition. The census
is executable: `packages/dashboard-server/src/__tests__/suite-parent-debris-census.test.ts` holds
the frozen register these tables are generated from, and reds if the tree drifts from it in either
direction — a debris site that is not registered, or a registered site that is not there.

### The two predicates, and why they are not one predicate twice

Phase 402 has defeated four separate instrument shapes: a symbol grep satisfied by an import line
(402-01, 402-03), a source assertion satisfied by its own file (WINDOWS #253, #257), a fold from a
DECLARED binding rather than from what answered (#251), and a behavioural differential blind to a
byte-identical private copy (#257). Two greps with different regexes would have been a fifth.

- **Predicate A — lexical.** Reads source TEXT. Walks `packages/<pkg>/src` for every package that
  HAS one (discovered from disk, never a pinned list), excluding `dist`, `node_modules`, `__tests__`
  and `*.test.ts`. Keys each hit as `file | token | trimmed-source-line`, which survives line-number
  drift. Sees comments, type literals, and a renamed-file copy. Blind to a RENAMED symbol and to
  behaviour.
- **Predicate B — structural.** Reads no source text at all. Seeds two databases identical in every
  byte except one fact — whether the member rows' `parent_run_id` points at the parent — then walks
  the WHOLE `DashboardDatabase` and `JobQueue` prototypes (`Object.getOwnPropertyNames`, every
  member, eight argument tuples each), drives the run route corpus, and drives every production
  channel. A member whose observable output or database effect differs between the two databases
  reads the parent link, under any name, in any file, however spelled.

**They found different things, which is the point.** Predicate A found the `suite-parent` /
`suite-child` kind mints, the `cancelChildRuns` fan-out, and the type breadth. Predicate B found
**ten additional link-reading database members** that name no debris token at all and that predicate
A is structurally incapable of seeing — every `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw
SQL (`getRuns`, `getRunsBySuiteId(+Count)`, `getRunsByTestName(+Count)`, `getStats`,
`getSuiteTrends`, `getTestTrends`, `getInsightsBreakdown`, `listRunsForInsights`) plus
`deleteRun`'s recursive `run_tree` cascade. It also found a producer predicate A could not see: the
`AGENT_QA_PARENT_RUN_ID` retry-correlation mode of the dashboard ingest, which spells no debris
token and had been producer-less since 401-07 retired the machinery that set the variable.

**How I know the discovery was complete, rather than asserting it.** Four controls ship with the
census, each one closing a way a census can be green at rest:

1. *Universe control.* The scan enumerates `packages/*` from disk, and asserts that **every package
   that has a `src/` directory contributed at least one scanned file** (1,201 files at time of
   writing). A glob that silently narrowed — the 401-10 failure — reds here rather than passing with
   a smaller denominator.
2. *Known-positive control.* The extractor is run over a synthetic source carrying planted tokens
   and must find exactly them. A broken extractor cannot read as "nothing to find".
3. *Exclusion control.* The excluded `__tests__` region is scanned separately and must be
   NON-EMPTY — proving the exclusion is what hides those matches, not a broken glob — and none of
   its hits may appear in the production scan.
4. *Non-vacuity controls.* The two seeded databases must be byte-identical apart from the link
   (asserted), and the route corpus must contain routes that DO differ (asserted `> 2`).

**The honest limit.** The route corpus is DECLARED, not discovered: `routes.ts` is a long `if`-chain
with no enumerable route table. Two things keep that from being the fold-from-a-declaration failure
402-07 measured — `routes.ts` issues no SQL of its own (verified: zero `prepare(`/`SELECT` in the
file), so every parent-link read it can make must go through the database surface predicate B
enumerates TOTALLY; and the corpus carries its own non-vacuity assertion. A route outside the corpus
that reads the link would still be caught by predicate A at its call site.

### What was deleted

1. **The queue's child-run cancellation fan-out** (`job-queue.ts` `cancelChildRuns` + both call
   sites). Cancelling a run no longer walks a child list.
2. **The parent-kind enqueue mints** on `POST /api/queue/enqueue` and `POST /api/runs/trigger`. An
   enqueued suite run is minted as an ordinary run artifact.
3. **The dashboard ingest's suite mode** — the live producer. It created a `suite-parent` artifact
   for the run plus one `suite-child` row per member carrying `parent_run_id`. A parallel suite is
   now ONE run row with member handles (402-04's handle addressing), per D-11.
4. **The dashboard ingest's retry mode**, producer-less since 401-07 (D-12) retired
   `AGENT_QA_PARENT_RUN_ID`. "Anything the one-run model leaves producer-less goes too" (D-11).
5. **The run-close suite fold and the startup orphan-cleanup skip** in `server.ts`, both of which
   derived a parent's fate from children that no longer exist. Same shape, same site, and the same
   reasoning as 401-07's retry-child retirement.
6. **The CLI's suite parent-kind mint and its SIGINT child-cancel fan-out**, plus the now
   unreachable `'suite-parent' | 'suite-child'` breadth on `buildRunArtifactContext`'s local kind
   parameter.

### What was RETAINED, and why

- **`RunArtifactKind`'s `'suite-parent'` and `'suite-child'` union members** — in
  `packages/schema/src/run/run-artifact.ts` (canonical), `packages/dashboard-ui/src/lib/api.ts` (the
  UI's copy), and the `run_artifacts.kind` CHECK constraint in `db/schema.ts`. This follows the
  396-01 D-10 precedent: **D-11 deletes the PRODUCERS of the value, not the value.** Every operator
  database holds rows carrying these kinds; the run-detail artifact tab renders `artifact.kind`
  verbatim as a badge, so a union that no longer admits the value stops type-checking at the render
  site, and a narrowed CHECK constraint would additionally require a table-rebuild migration on
  every existing database.
- **`runs.parent_run_id`, its index, and every read of it.** The column keeps its historical values
  and simply stops receiving new ones. All ten `parent_run_id IS NULL` filters predicate B found are
  top-level-run predicates that keep working unchanged; `deleteRun`'s recursive cascade must survive
  or the historical rows this census orphans become undeletable through the UI.
- **`getRunsByParent` and `getRunArtifactBundle`'s child section**, and the four route reads that
  serve them (`GET /api/runs`, `GET /api/runs/:id`, `GET /api/runs/:id/artifact`,
  `GET /api/runs/:id/execution-logs`), together with the `RESPONSE_SAFE_RUN_READ_METHODS` allowlist
  membership and metadata-scrubbing override that guard them. **Historical rows are not orphaned
  silently:** a pre-402 suite parent still lists its members in the run list and the run detail, and
  a census cell drives exactly that against a seeded operator-shaped database.
- **`use.parallel` on the job queue** as CROSS-RUN concurrency of INDEPENDENT jobs
  (`findNextEligible`). D-11 permits this explicitly: what is deleted is parallel-SUITE semantics,
  not the queue's ability to run two unrelated jobs at once.

### What degrades, stated plainly

A suite started from the dashboard now produces **one** run row instead of a parent plus one row per
member. Until 405 rebuilds the run detail on 402-04's per-member handles, the dashboard shows a
suite run's steps on the single run row rather than split per member, and the run list shows no
member expansion for NEW suite runs (historical ones still expand). The artifact `kind` for such a
run is `'test'`; the run row's `suite_id` and the artifact's own `source.kind: 'suite'` snapshot
still identify it as a suite, so nothing a reader needs is lost — only the parenthood claim, which
is exactly the claim that no longer has referents. This is a deliberate D-11 cost, not an oversight.

### Not resolved here

**WINDOWS #238 stays OPEN.** `use.parallel` still carries two meanings: the dashboard job queue's
cross-run eligibility flag (`findNextEligible`, read via `readConfigUseParallel` /
`readSuiteYamlParallel`) and, since 402-03, within-run member concurrency. D-11 sanctions the queue
meaning, so the debris deletion does not touch either producer and therefore does not resolve the
ambiguity. Splitting or renaming the key is a config-schema change, out of this plan's scope.

### The register

Generated from the frozen literal in `suite-parent-debris-census.test.ts` — that file is the source
of truth, this table is its rendering. `Before` is the tree as 402-08 left it; `After` is the tree
this plan produced.

### Sites — predicate A (lexical)

| # | File | Token | Source line | Before | After | Disposition | Rationale |
|---|------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const children = activeSuiteDb.getRunsByParent(run.id)` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | CLI SIGINT child-cancellation fan-out. Under the one-run model the suite run IS the row the sweep already cancels; there are no children to fan out to. |
| 2 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-child` | `kind: 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child'` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Same local parameter breadth (the suite-child arm of the same literal). |
| 3 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-child` | `}) as { artifact: Record<string, unknown> & { kind: 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' } }` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Same local cast breadth (the suite-child arm). |
| 4 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-child` | `}): { artifact: Record<string, unknown> & { kind: 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' } } {` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Same local return-type breadth (the suite-child arm). |
| 5 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-parent` | `kind: 'suite-parent',` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The CLI-side parent-kind mint on the suite run artifact document. A kind claiming parenthood over rows nothing creates is exactly the label D-11 forbids. |
| 6 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-parent` | `kind: 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child'` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Local parameter breadth on buildRunArtifactContext. With the mint gone both call sites pass 'test'; the surviving arms are unreachable breadth, not the retained schema union. |
| 7 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-parent` | `}) as { artifact: Record<string, unknown> & { kind: 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' } }` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Local cast breadth on buildRunArtifactContext. |
| 8 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-parent` | `}): { artifact: Record<string, unknown> & { kind: 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' } } {` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Local return-type breadth on buildRunArtifactContext. |
| 9 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/queue/job-queue.ts` | `cancelChildRuns` | `private cancelChildRuns(parentRunId: string, endedAt: string): void {` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The child-run cancellation fan-out named in D-11. |
| 10 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/queue/job-queue.ts` | `cancelChildRuns` | `this.cancelChildRuns(runId, now)` | 2 | 0 | **DELETE** | Both call sites of the fan-out (pending-cancel and running-cancel arms). |
| 11 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/queue/job-queue.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `for (const child of this.db.getRunsByParent(parentRunId)) {` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The fan-out body; goes with the method. |
| 12 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/reporter/dashboard-subscriber.ts` | `suite-child` | `insertArtifact(id, 'suite-child')` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The ingest child-row artifact mint, written per suite member alongside a run row carrying parent_run_id. Deleted with the suite ingest mode itself. |
| 13 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/reporter/dashboard-subscriber.ts` | `suite-parent` | `const kind: RunArtifactKind = mode === 'suite' ? 'suite-parent' : 'test'` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The ingest parent-kind mint. This module is the LIVE producer of new parent/child run records — the dashboard suite door still reaches it — so the truth "no producer survives" is false while it stands. |
| 14 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `suite-parent` | `kind: isSuite ? 'suite-parent' : 'test',` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The same mint on POST /api/runs/trigger — the door the dashboard UI actually uses. |
| 15 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `suite-parent` | `kind: isSuiteFile ? 'suite-parent' : 'test',` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The parent-kind mint on POST /api/queue/enqueue named in D-11. |
| 16 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/server.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const children = db.getRunsByParent(run.id)` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Startup orphan-cleanup skip: leaves a suite parent stuck in `running` when a child still reads `running`. After a restart nothing is running, and with no child producer the skip can only strand historical rows in a state no process will ever finish. |
| 17 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/server.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const children = db.getRunsByParent(runId)` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | Run-close suite fold: derives the parent row's status from its children. With no child producer this can only ever read an empty list, so it is dead code reading as live policy — the same shape 401-07 retired for retry children at this exact site. |
| 18 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/server.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const updatedChildren = db.getRunsByParent(runId)` | 1 | 0 | **DELETE** | The second half of the same fold (re-read after forcing incomplete children). |
| 19 | `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `suite-parent` | `// single-test analog of Plan 10's suite-parent parallel drop under the one-RunSession law).` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | Historical prose. A comment naming a retirement that already happened is a record, not a producer; deleting it would erase the reason a later reader needs. |
| 20 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/db/database.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const children = this.getRunsByParent(runId).map((run) => ({` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | getRunArtifactBundle's child section, served by GET /api/runs/:id/artifact. Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 21 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/db/database.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `getRunsByParent(parentRunId: string): RunRow[] {` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | The declaration of the historical read the run list and run detail serve. Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 22 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/db/schema.ts` | `suite-child` | `kind TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(kind IN ('test', 'suite-parent', 'suite-child', 'unknown')),` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | Same CHECK constraint (the suite-child arm). |
| 23 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/db/schema.ts` | `suite-parent` | `kind TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(kind IN ('test', 'suite-parent', 'suite-child', 'unknown')),` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | RETAINED union member (396-01 D-10 precedent): existing run_artifacts rows carry these kinds and must keep parsing. Deleting the value orphans every historical row. Narrowing the CHECK would additionally require a table rebuild migration on every operator database. |
| 24 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `'getRunsByParent',` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | RESPONSE_SAFE_RUN_READ_METHODS membership. The 401-23 allowlist asserts SET EQUALITY with the database's run reads at construction; dropping the name while the method survives throws at router build. |
| 25 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const attempts = db.getRunsByParent(id)` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | GET /api/runs/:id — the run-DETAIL read. Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 26 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const childRuns = db.getRunsByParent(id)` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | GET /api/runs/:id/execution-logs aggregates a historical suite's member logs. Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 27 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const tests = db.getRunsByParent(id)` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | GET /api/runs/:id member list for a historical suite parent. Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 28 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `const tests = db.getRunsByParent(run.id).map(test => enrichRunRow(test, targetPlatforms))` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | GET /api/runs — the run-LIST read. Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 29 | `packages/dashboard-server/src/server/routes.ts` | `getRunsByParent` | `getRunsByParent: { value: (parentRunId: string) => scrubRows(db.getRunsByParent(parentRunId)) },` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | The metadata-scrubbing override for the same read. A surviving read that lost its scrub would leak server-derived run metadata (401-23). |
| 30 | `packages/dashboard-ui/src/lib/api.ts` | `suite-child` | `export type RunArtifactKind = 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' \| 'unknown'` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | Same UI-side union (the suite-child arm). |
| 31 | `packages/dashboard-ui/src/lib/api.ts` | `suite-parent` | `export type RunArtifactKind = 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' \| 'unknown'` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | RETAINED union member (396-01 D-10 precedent): existing run_artifacts rows carry these kinds and must keep parsing. Deleting the value orphans every historical row. The UI renders this value verbatim as the artifact badge, so a historical row whose kind the type does not admit stops type-checking at the render site. |
| 32 | `packages/schema/src/run/run-artifact.ts` | `suite-child` | `export type RunArtifactKind = 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' \| 'unknown'` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | Same canonical union (the suite-child arm). |
| 33 | `packages/schema/src/run/run-artifact.ts` | `suite-parent` | `export type RunArtifactKind = 'test' \| 'suite-parent' \| 'suite-child' \| 'unknown'` | 1 | 1 | **KEEP** | RETAINED union member (396-01 D-10 precedent): existing run_artifacts rows carry these kinds and must keep parsing. Deleting the value orphans every historical row. This is the canonical union; the D-11 ruling deletes the PRODUCERS of the value, not the value. |

### Surfaces — predicate B (structural, behaviour-observed)

| # | Surface | Kind | Disposition | Registered sites | Rationale |
|---|---------|------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | `ingest:createDashboardRunIngest retry correlation` | producer | **DELETE** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Already producer-less before this plan — 401-07 (D-12) retired the machinery that set AGENT_QA_PARENT_RUN_ID, so nothing can reach this mode. "Anything the one-run model leaves producer-less goes too" (D-11). Predicate A never saw it (it spells no debris token); predicate B found it by producing a linked row. |
| 2 | `ingest:createDashboardRunIngest suite correlation` | producer | **DELETE** | `dashboard-subscriber.ts :: suite-parent const kind: RunArtifactKind = mode === 'suite' ? 'suite-parent' : 'test'`<br>`dashboard-subscriber.ts :: suite-child insertArtifact(id, 'suite-child')` | The live producer of new parent/child run records: a parent row of kind suite-parent plus one linked child row per member. A parallel suite is ONE run row with member handles (D-11). |
| 3 | `route:POST /api/queue/enqueue (suite file)` | producer | **DELETE** | `routes.ts :: suite-parent kind: isSuiteFile ? 'suite-parent' : 'test',` | The parent-kind mint D-11 names. |
| 4 | `route:POST /api/runs/trigger (suite file)` | producer | **DELETE** | `routes.ts :: suite-parent kind: isSuite ? 'suite-parent' : 'test',` | The same mint on the door the dashboard UI uses. |
| 5 | `queue:cancel` | reader | **DELETE** | `job-queue.ts :: cancelChildRuns this.cancelChildRuns(runId, now)`<br>`job-queue.ts :: cancelChildRuns private cancelChildRuns(parentRunId: string, endedAt: string): void {`<br>`job-queue.ts :: getRunsByParent for (const child of this.db.getRunsByParent(parentRunId)) {` | The child-cancellation fan-out D-11 names. Its link-reading effect is what the queue walk observes; after the deletion cancelling a parent leaves historical members untouched. |
| 6 | `route:POST /api/runs/:id/cancel` | reader | **DELETE** | `job-queue.ts :: cancelChildRuns this.cancelChildRuns(runId, now)` | The HTTP door onto queue:cancel. It stays a route; what goes is its link-reading effect. |
| 7 | `db:deleteRun` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | The recursive `run_tree` cascade. Deleting a historical suite parent must still delete its members, or the rows this census orphans become undeletable through the UI. Reads the link in raw SQL, which is why predicate A never saw it and predicate B did. |
| 8 | `db:getInsightsBreakdown` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Insights breakdowns; its suite/platform dimensions split on the link. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 9 | `db:getRunArtifactBundle` | reader | **KEEP** | `database.ts :: getRunsByParent const children = this.getRunsByParent(runId).map((run) => ({` | Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. Served by GET /api/runs/:id/artifact. |
| 10 | `db:getRuns` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | The run-list query itself: `parent_run_id IS NULL` is its first condition. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 11 | `db:getRunsByParent` | reader | **KEEP** | `database.ts :: getRunsByParent getRunsByParent(parentRunId: string): RunRow[] {` | Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 12 | `db:getRunsBySuiteId` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Suite drill-down listing. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 13 | `db:getRunsBySuiteIdCount` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | The paging total for the same listing. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 14 | `db:getRunsByTestName` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Test-history listing. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 15 | `db:getRunsByTestNameCount` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | The paging total for the same listing. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 16 | `db:getStats` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Dashboard headline counters. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 17 | `db:getSuiteTrends` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Suite trend series. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 18 | `db:getTestTrends` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Test trend series. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 19 | `db:listRunsForInsights` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | The private row source getInsightsBreakdown folds; on the prototype, so the walk reaches it directly. A `parent_run_id IS NULL` top-level-run filter in raw SQL. Predicate A is structurally blind to these — they name no debris token — and predicate B found all ten by differential. KEEP, and required: a child row admitted as a top-level run would double-count every historical suite in the list, the counts and the trend series. |
| 20 | `route:DELETE /api/runs/:id` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Serves db:deleteRun and inherits its disposition. |
| 21 | `route:GET /api/runs` | reader | **KEEP** | `routes.ts :: getRunsByParent const tests = db.getRunsByParent(run.id).map(test => enrichRunRow(test, targetPlatforms))` | Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 22 | `route:GET /api/runs/:id` | reader | **KEEP** | `routes.ts :: getRunsByParent const attempts = db.getRunsByParent(id)`<br>`routes.ts :: getRunsByParent const tests = db.getRunsByParent(id)` | Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |
| 23 | `route:GET /api/runs/:id/artifact` | reader | **KEEP** | _(reached only in raw SQL / by composition — no debris token)_ | Serves getRunArtifactBundle, whose child section is registered above. |
| 24 | `route:GET /api/runs/:id/execution-logs` | reader | **KEEP** | `routes.ts :: getRunsByParent const childRuns = db.getRunsByParent(id)` | Historical-row read. The one-run model produces no new children, but operator databases hold rows written before 402 and the pre-405 run list / run detail must keep rendering them. |

### Operational notes for the next reader

**A debris token inside a retirement comment reds the lexical arm.** Predicate A reads source TEXT,
so the dated notes this plan left where the deleted code used to stand cannot spell
`getRunsByParent` / `cancelChildRuns` / `suite-parent` / `suite-child`. Three of them did on the
first pass and the census caught all three. They were REWORDED rather than registered: adding this
plan's own explanatory prose to the register would inflate the denominator with text the register
exists to describe. Same class as WINDOWS #241 (prose tripping a source scan), and the same
resolution — reword the prose, do not widen the guard.

**Where the census does NOT reach, stated so nobody infers otherwise.**

- The legacy `/api/execution/events` projection (`dashboard-ui/src/lib/live-timeline.ts`, ~30
  `parentRunId` references, plus `ExecutionLiveIdentity.parentRunId` in `lib/api.ts`) is untouched.
  It is a live-event projection, not a run-record read, no dashboard-server module puts
  `parentRunId` on those events, and 405 rebuilds it. The 405 build-order pin 402-08 recorded holds.
- Predicate B's route corpus is declared (see "The honest limit" above).
- Nothing here measures the dashboard END TO END — a real browser driving a real suite through the
  changed ingest. The claim proven is at the API and database layer: no producer mints a
  parent/child record, and an operator-shaped database still renders through the shipped routes.

### Gate at the time of writing (2026-08-24)

`pnpm build` · `pnpm test --force` · `pnpm validate:arch` · the conformance suite on the rebuilt
dist. Every workspace package green; the ONE red is the pre-existing `tools/embedding-bench`
`tau-lex` receipt failure, which predates this phase and is untouched by it.
